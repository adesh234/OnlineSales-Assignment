Task 1:

Solution -
Select d.NAME as "DEPT_NAME", avg(s.AMT) as "AVG_MONTHLY_SALARY (USD)" from Salaries as s
join Employees as e  On e.id=s.EMP_ID
Join Departments as d  On d.ID=e.DEPT_ID
Group by d.Name
order by avg(s.AMT) desc limit 3 ;

Task 3:

    def compute(n):
        if n < 10:
            out = n ** 2
        elif n < 20:
            out = 1
            for i in range(1, n-9): // Here the range will be n-9 for correct factorial
                out *= i
        else:
            lim = n - 19
            out = lim * lim
            out = out + lim // Here we will add out and lim and then divide by 2 for sum of int from 1 to n-20
            out = out / 2
        print(out)
